#+TITLE: Truffle Implementation Detalis

* TODO @ExportLibrary
- unclear what it does
- probably related to inter language implementation communication
- unclear what method names must be used, where does isArray() come from?
- InteropLibrary.class

* @TruffleBoundary
- where partial evaluation should stop
- developer is in control
- where it stops, function calls are performed instead of inlining

* Scoping
