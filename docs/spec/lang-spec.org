* PHP Language Specification
** About
This file references the PHP Language Spec based on https://www.php.net/manual/en/.
A copy of the specification was downloaded and resides in the same directory.
For convenience the links refer to the online version which may be subject to change.

There is also an attempt by Facebook to specify PHP. It is hosted here:
https://github.com/php/php-langspec/tree/master/spec. It comes with a test suite for
feature compliance.
