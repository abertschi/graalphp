#+TITLE: Array Design Notes

* TransitionLimit in Export Library
- https://github.com/oracle/graal/blob/master/truffle/src/com.oracle.truffle.api.library.test/src/com/oracle/truffle/api/library/test/AcceptsTransitionTest.java


* Array Behavior
- Arrays are copied by value by default
- our current implementation assigns PhpArray which is an instance. We do not copy yet.
  - ideally we implement a copy on write mechanism as copying is expensive.
