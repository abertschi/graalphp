/**
 * Represents a SL function. On the Truffle level, a callable element is represented by a
 * {@link RootCallTarget call target}. This class encapsulates a call target, and adds version
 * support: functions in SL can be redefined, i.e. changed at run time. When a function is
 * redefined, the call target managed by this function object is changed (and {@link #callTarget} is
 * therefore not a final field).
 * <p>
 * Function redefinition is expected to be rare, therefore optimized call nodes want to speculate
 * that the call target is stable. This is possible with the help of a Truffle {@link Assumption}: a
 * call node can keep the call target returned by {@link #getCallTarget()} cached until the
 * assumption returned by {@link #getCallTargetStable()} is valid.
 * <p>
 * The {@link #callTarget} can be {@code null}. To ensure that only one {@link SLFunction} instance
 * per name exists, the {@link SLFunctionRegistry} creates an instance also when performing name
 * lookup. A function that has been looked up, i.e., used, but not defined, has a call target that
 * encapsulates a {@link SLUndefinedFunctionRootNode}.
