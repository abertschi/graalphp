# SimpleLanguage

A simple demonstration language built using Truffle for the GraalVM.

SimpleLanguage is heavily documented to explain the how and why of writing a
Truffle language. A good way to find out more is to read the source with
comments. Start reading [here](https://github.com/graalvm/simplelanguage/blob/master/language/src/main/java/com/oracle/truffle/sl/SLLanguage.java). 
We also like to encourage people to clone the repository and start hacking.

This repository is licensed under the permissive UPL licence. Fork it to begin
your own Truffle language.
